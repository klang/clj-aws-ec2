# clj-aws-ec2

A Clojure library for accessing Amazon EC2, based on the official AWS
Java SDK and borrowing heavily from James Reeves's [clj-aws-s3][]
library.

This is a very early development version. Currently the library only
supports functions to list/describe EC2 reservations, instances and
machine images (AMIs), and to start and stop EBS-backed instances. See
[TODO][] for future plans.

## Install

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

    [![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/clj-aws-ec2/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/clj-aws-ec2)

## Example

```clojure
(require '[aws.sdk.ec2 :as ec2])

(def cred {:access-key "...", :secret-key "..."})

(ec2/describe-instances cred)
(ec2/describe-instances cred (ec2/instance-id-filter "i-deadcafe"))
(ec2/describe-instances cred (ec2/instance-filter (ec2/aws-filter "instance-state-name" "running")
                                                  (ec2/aws-filter "tag-key" "role")))

(ec2/describe-images cred (ec2/image-owner-filter "self"))
(ec2/describe-images cred (ec2/image-id-filter "ami-3c47a355"))
(ec2/describe-images cred (ec2/image-filter (ec2/aws-filter "tag-key" "latest")
                                            (ec2/aws-filter "tag-key" "webserver")))

(ec2/start-instances cred "i-beefcafe")
(ec2/stop-instances cred "i-beefcafe" "i-deadbabe")


(ec2/run-instances cred { :min-count 1
                          :max-count 1
                          :image-id "ami-9465dbfd"
                          :instance-type "t1.micro"
                          :key-name "my-key" })
(ec2/terminate-instances cred "i-beefcafe" "i-deadbabe")

(ec2/create-image cred { :instance-id "i-deadbabe"
                         :name "web-snapshot"
                         :description "Snapshot of web server" })
(ec2/deregister-image cred "ami-07f9756e")

(ec2/describe-tags cred (ec2/tag-filter-by-resource-id "id-babecafe"))
(ec2/describe-tags cred (ec2/tag-filter-by-resource-type "image"))
(ec2/create-tags cred ["id-deadcafe", "ami-9465dbfd"] {:name "web server" :owner "ops"})
(ec2/delete-tags cred ["id-deadcafe"] {:owner nil})


(ec2/describe-volumes cred)
(ec2/describe-volumes cred (ec2/volume-id-filter "vol-98765432"))
(ec2/describe-volumes cred (ec2/volume-snapshot-filter "snap-abcd1234"))
(ec2/describe-volumes cred (ec2/volume-status-filter :available)))
```

Refer to the
[API docs](http://mikerowecode.com/clj-aws-ec2/aws.sdk.ec2.html#var-run-instances)
for a more detailed example of the parameters available to
`run-instances`.

### Using regions

To use a region other than `us-east-1` you can specify an API endpoint
in the credentials map:

```clojure
(def cred {:access-key "...", :secret-key "...", :endpoint "ec2.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com"})
```

Refer to [Regions and Endpoints][] for a list of current EC2 endpoints.

[Regions and Endpoints]: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ec2_region

### Exception handling

You can catch exceptions and extract details of the error condition:

```clojure
(try
  (ec2/start-instances cred "i-beefcafe")
  (catch Exception e (ec2/decode-exception e)))
```

`ec2/decode-exception` provides a map with the following keys:

    :error-code
    :error-type
    :service-name
    :status-code
